# Casa Paraiso Implementation Roadmap

## Purpose

Define the build sequence for the Casa Paraiso Spa Appointment and Management System after the MVP scope, tech stack, database design, and screen flow have been approved.

This roadmap is the final pre-build planning document. After it is accepted, the next step is application scaffolding and implementation.

## Guiding Sources

Use these documents as implementation sources of truth:

- `docs/MVP_SCOPE.md`
- `docs/TECH_STACK.md`
- `docs/DATABASE_DESIGN.md`
- `docs/SCREEN_FLOW.md`

## Phase 0: Pre-Scaffold Preparation

Goal: confirm the local environment is ready before creating the Laravel application.

Tasks:

- Update Composer to the latest stable version because the current local Composer version was previously detected as outdated/vulnerable.
- Confirm PHP is 8.2 or higher.
- Confirm required PHP extensions are enabled.
- Confirm Node and npm are available for Vite and Tailwind asset builds.
- Confirm XAMPP MySQL/MariaDB is available locally.
- Decide whether to initialize Git before scaffolding.
- Create a local database for the app, such as `casa_paraiso`.

Verification:

```bash
php -v
composer --version
composer diagnose
node --version
npm --version
```

Acceptance:

- Composer no longer reports the known vulnerable/outdated installed version.
- PHP, Composer, Node, npm, and MySQL/MariaDB are ready for Laravel scaffolding.

## Phase 1: Laravel And Auth Scaffold

Goal: create the Laravel application foundation.

Tasks:

- Scaffold Laravel 12 in the project root.

- Set `APP_TIMEZONE=Asia/Manila`.
- Confirm `.env` is not committed.
- Build frontend assets.
- Run the default Laravel test suite.

Verification:

```bash
composer install
npm install
npm run build
php artisan test
```

Acceptance:

- Laravel loads locally.
- Breeze login and registration pages render.
- Tailwind styles compile successfully.
- Default tests pass.

## Phase 2: Roles, Redirects, And Access Control

Goal: make authentication match the approved admin, staff, and customer roles.

## Build Order Rule

Do not start a later feature phase until the earlier dependency phase is working locally. For example, appointments should not be built before services, staff, schedules, and customers exist.

The MVP is complete when:

- Admin, staff, and customer authentication works.
- Admin can manage services, staff, schedules, customers, transactions, promotions, feedback, and reports.
- Staff can handle daily appointment and transaction workflows.
- Customers can request appointments, view status/history, update profile, and submit feedback.
- RFM promotion suggestions are stored and reviewable.
- Feedback sentiment is classified without external AI services.
- CSV reports are available for admin.
- The app builds successfully with Tailwind/Vite.
- Laravel tests pass.
- Hostinger deployment and handover notes exist.
