# Casa Paraiso Implementation Roadmap

## Purpose

Define the build sequence for the Casa Paraiso Spa Appointment and Management System after the MVP scope, tech stack, database design, and screen flow have been approved.

This roadmap is the final pre-build planning document. After it is accepted, the next step is application scaffolding and implementation.

## Guiding Sources

Use these documents as implementation sources of truth:

- `docs/MVP_SCOPE.md`
- `docs/TECH_STACK.md`
- `docs/DATABASE_DESIGN.md`
- `docs/SCREEN_FLOW.md`
- `docs/DOCKER_WORKFLOW.md`

## Current Environment Direction

Docker Compose with Laravel Sail services is the primary local development workflow. XAMPP remains a fallback local workflow. Hostinger shared/web hosting remains the production target, so Docker must not become a production requirement unless the deployment target changes to VPS.

## Phase 0: Pre-Scaffold Preparation

Goal: confirm the local environment is ready before feature development.

Tasks:

- Confirm Docker and Docker Compose are available.
- Use Sail-generated Docker Compose services as the primary local runtime.
- Confirm Docker Compose services start.
- Confirm the MariaDB service is available.
- Keep XAMPP available only as fallback.

Verification:

```bash
php -v
composer --version
composer diagnose
node --version
npm --version
docker --version
docker compose version
docker compose up -d
```

Acceptance:

- Docker, Compose, Sail services, and MariaDB are ready for local development.
- Host PHP/Composer/npm remain usable as fallback only.

## Phase 1: Laravel And Auth Scaffold

Goal: keep the Laravel application foundation reproducible under Docker Compose.

Tasks:

- Maintain Laravel 12 and Breeze Blade templates.
- Maintain Tailwind CSS through Vite.
- Configure `.env` for the Docker MariaDB service.
- Set `APP_TIMEZONE=Asia/Manila`.
- Confirm `.env` is not committed.
- Build frontend assets through the app container.
- Run the Laravel test suite through the app container.

Verification:

```bash
docker compose exec -T laravel.test composer install
docker compose exec -T laravel.test npm install
docker compose exec -T laravel.test npm run build
docker compose exec -T laravel.test php artisan test
```

Acceptance:

- Laravel loads locally through Docker Compose.
- Breeze login and registration pages render.
- Tailwind styles compile successfully.
- Default tests pass.

## Phase 2: Roles, Redirects, And Access Control

Goal: make authentication match the approved admin, staff, and customer roles.

Tasks:

- Add `role`, `phone`, and `is_active` fields to the `users` table.
- Define role constants or enums for `admin`, `staff`, and `customer`.
- Implement post-login redirects:
  - Admin to `/admin/dashboard`.
  - Staff to `/staff/dashboard`.
  - Customer to `/customer/appointments`.
- Restrict public registration to customer accounts only.
- Add middleware or policies for admin, staff, and customer access.
- Seed one admin user and optional demo staff/customer users.

Verification:

```bash
docker compose exec -T laravel.test php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
docker compose exec -T laravel.test php artisan test
```

Acceptance:

- Admin, staff, and customer users land on the correct pages after login.
- Customer registration cannot create admin or staff accounts.
- Users cannot access route groups outside their role.

## Phase 3: Database Schema, Models, And Seeders

Goal: implement the schema defined in `docs/DATABASE_DESIGN.md`.

Tasks:

  - Default Casa Paraiso package services: GAIA TOUCH, TETHYS FLOW, HESTIA WARMTH, and AURORA BREEZE.
  - Static public content for add-on prices, business hours, and the reservation tagline.
  - Staff-service assignments.
  - Weekly staff schedules.
  - Default RFM segments.
  - Default promotion rules.
- Add model-level constants or enums for all status values.

Verification:

```bash
docker compose exec -T laravel.test php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
docker compose exec -T laravel.test php artisan test
```

Acceptance:

- All tables migrate successfully on a clean database.
- Seeded users, real package services, staff schedules, and RFM rules exist.

docker compose exec -T laravel.test php artisan test
```

Acceptance:

- App can be installed from a clean checkout.
- Core workflows pass manual and automated checks.
- Deployment and handover documentation are clear enough for non-technical maintenance with occasional developer support.

## Build Order Rule

Do not start a later feature phase until the earlier dependency phase is working locally. For example, appointments should not be built before services, staff, schedules, and customers exist.

## MVP Completion Definition

The MVP is complete when:

- Admin, staff, and customer authentication works.
- Admin can manage services, staff, schedules, customers, transactions, promotions, feedback, and reports.
- Staff can handle daily appointment and transaction workflows.
- Customers can request appointments, view status/history, update profile, and submit feedback.
- RFM promotion suggestions are stored and reviewable.
- Feedback sentiment is classified without external AI services.
- CSV reports are available for admin.
- The app builds successfully with Tailwind/Vite.
- Laravel tests pass.
- Hostinger deployment and handover notes exist.
