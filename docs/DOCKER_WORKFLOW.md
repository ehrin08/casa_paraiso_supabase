# Casa Paraiso Docker Workflow

## Purpose

Use Laravel Sail's Docker services as the primary local development environment for Casa Paraiso.

Docker is for local development only. Production remains Hostinger shared/web hosting, so the project must not require Docker, VPS access, persistent Node.js services, Redis, custom daemons, or server-level package management in production.

## Services

The Sail-generated Compose setup uses:

- `laravel.test`: Laravel app container using Sail PHP 8.2.
- `mariadb`: local MariaDB database for development.
- `mailpit`: local email testing.

The app is served through the Laravel app container. It does not use a custom Nginx/PHP-FPM stack for this MVP.

The container mounts its `vendor/` directory from the `sail-vendor` named volume. Keeping Composer packages on Docker's Linux filesystem avoids repeatedly loading Laravel framework files through the slower Windows bind mount. Application source files remain bind-mounted for immediate editing.

On this Windows machine, use `docker compose` directly. The `vendor\bin\sail.bat` wrapper depends on a working Bash/WSL shim, and that shim is not currently reliable here.

## Local URLs

- App: `http://localhost:8001`
- Vite: `http://localhost:5173`
- MariaDB forwarded port: `3307`
- Mailpit SMTP forwarded port: `1026`
- Mailpit dashboard: `http://localhost:8025`

These ports avoid common conflicts with XAMPP Apache on port 80 and XAMPP MySQL on port 3306.

## First-Time Setup

From the project root, install dependencies first if `vendor/` or `node_modules/` is missing:

```powershell
composer install
npm install
```

Then start the Docker services and verify the app:

```powershell
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec -T laravel.test composer install
docker compose restart laravel.test
docker compose exec -T laravel.test php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
docker compose exec -T laravel.test npm run build
docker compose exec -T laravel.test php artisan test
```

The host `composer install` is still needed after a clean clone because Sail's Docker build context comes from `vendor/laravel/sail`. The in-container install populates the separate `sail-vendor` volume used by the running application. Restart `laravel.test` afterward because its web process may have stopped while the empty volume was being populated.

When `composer.lock` changes, refresh both dependency locations:

```powershell
composer install
docker compose exec -T laravel.test composer install
```

Do not delete the `sail-vendor` volume during normal shutdown. `docker compose down` keeps it; `docker compose down -v` removes it and requires another in-container Composer install.

## Daily Commands

Start containers:

```powershell
docker compose up -d
```

Stop containers:

```powershell
docker compose down
```

Run migrations:

```powershell
docker compose exec laravel.test php artisan migrate
```

Refresh PHP dependencies after a Composer change:

```powershell
composer install
docker compose exec -T laravel.test composer install
```

Run tests:

```powershell
docker compose exec laravel.test php artisan test
```

Build frontend assets:

```powershell
docker compose exec laravel.test npm run build
```

If a host-side `npm run build` reports a missing Rollup optional dependency such as
`@rollup/rollup-win32-x64-msvc`, restore the host dependency tree without changing
`package-lock.json`:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
npm install
```

Use the Docker build command above as the primary verification path.

Start Vite dev server:

```powershell
docker compose exec laravel.test npm run dev
```

## Environment Defaults

Use these local Docker values:

```env
APP_URL=http://localhost:8001
APP_PORT=8001
VITE_PORT=5173
DB_CONNECTION=mariadb
DB_HOST=mariadb
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=casa_paraiso
DB_USERNAME=sail
DB_PASSWORD=password
FORWARD_DB_PORT=3307
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=mailpit
MAIL_PORT=1025
FORWARD_MAILPIT_PORT=1026
FORWARD_MAILPIT_DASHBOARD_PORT=8025
```

## XAMPP Fallback

XAMPP can remain installed as a fallback local environment, but future project work should prefer Docker Compose commands.

If using XAMPP instead of Sail:

- Set `DB_HOST=127.0.0.1`.
- Set `DB_USERNAME=root`.
- Use the XAMPP MySQL database manually.
- Run PHP/Composer/npm commands on the host machine.

## Production Boundary

Do not deploy Sail containers to Hostinger shared/web hosting.

For Hostinger:

- Build assets locally with Docker Compose or host Node.
- Upload/deploy the Laravel application using Hostinger-compatible PHP hosting.
- Configure production `.env` with Hostinger database credentials.
- Set `APP_ENV=production` and `APP_DEBUG=false`.
- Point web requests to Laravel's `public/index.php` entrypoint or equivalent shared-hosting setup.
- When Hostinger Terminal or SSH is available, install and optimize after the production `.env` is configured:

```bash
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
php artisan optimize
```

`php artisan optimize` caches Laravel configuration, events, routes, and Blade views. Run it on the Linux hosting environment, not during normal Windows/XAMPP development. Re-run it after deploying application, route, configuration, or view changes.

## CRUD Remediation Verification And Recovery

Use the following sequence after deploying CRUD remediation code.

The remediation adds `2026_07_12_020000_add_generation_key_to_promotion_suggestions.php`. This nullable unique key makes promotion generation idempotent without rewriting historical suggestions. Treat it as an approval-gated schema change in every non-testing environment.

1. Create a database export before applying migrations or data repairs.
2. Obtain explicit approval for the exact migration or repair operation.
3. Apply migrations with `php artisan migrate --force` only in the intended environment.
4. Run the read-only integrity audit:

```powershell
docker compose exec -T laravel.test php artisan casa:audit-crud-integrity
```

5. Run the isolated Feature suite configured by `phpunit.xml` (the 2026-07-12 remediation baseline is 104 tests and 828 assertions):

```powershell
docker compose exec -T laravel.test php artisan test --testsuite=Feature
```

6. Run the remaining quality gates:

```powershell
docker compose exec -T laravel.test ./vendor/bin/pint --test
docker compose exec -T laravel.test composer validate
docker compose exec -T laravel.test php artisan view:cache
docker compose exec -T laravel.test npm run build
```

7. Verify the admin, staff, and customer workspaces in signed-in browser sessions, then inspect the browser console and `storage/logs/laravel.log` for new errors.

`composer validate` currently succeeds with an advisory that `laravel/socialite` is pinned to exact version `5.28`. Changing that dependency policy requires a separate Composer lockfile review and is not part of the CRUD remediation.

The integrity audit reports orphaned operational relationships and inconsistent status metadata. It never modifies records. A non-zero exit code means the reported records require review before deployment.

For current orphaned appointment findings and the approval-gated repair sequence, see `docs/CRUD_DATA_REPAIR_PLAN.md`.

The approved local repair was completed on 2026-07-12 using `casa:repair-approved-appointment-references --execute`. The command performs a safe dry run unless `--execute` is supplied and refuses to proceed if appointment status, therapist eligibility, schedule coverage, overlap, or deleted-reference conditions have changed.

### Rollback

- Keep the pre-change database export until post-deployment verification is complete.
- Roll back application files to the previous known-good release before restoring data.
- Restore the database export through the matching local database tool or Hostinger hPanel/phpMyAdmin.
- Do not run a broad production `migrate:rollback` without confirming every migration in the batch is safe to reverse.
- After restoration, run `php artisan optimize:clear`, then repeat the read-only integrity audit and browser smoke test.
