# Casa Paraiso Database Design

## Purpose

Define the MVP MariaDB/MySQL schema before Laravel migrations are scaffolded.

This design supports customer login, staff scheduling, appointment requests, manual transactions, RFM promotion suggestions, feedback sentiment, and management reporting.

## Design Rules

- Use Laravel migrations as the schema source of truth.
- Use unsigned big integer primary keys unless Laravel defaults change.
- Use `created_at` and `updated_at` on all business tables.
- Use `deleted_at` soft deletes only for records that should be hidden without losing history, such as services, profiles, and promotion rules.
- Store money as `decimal(10,2)`.
- Store dates and times in server time for MVP; use Asia/Manila as the business timezone in application config.
- Use MariaDB/MySQL-compatible column types and indexes.

## Status Values

- Appointment status: `pending`, `confirmed`, `completed`, `cancelled`, `no_show`
- Payment status: `unpaid`, `partial`, `paid`, `refunded`, `void`
- Sentiment label: `positive`, `neutral`, `negative`
- Promotion suggestion status: `suggested`, `reviewed`, `applied`, `dismissed`
- Schedule exception type: `available`, `unavailable`
- User role: `admin`, `staff`, `customer`

Use string columns for these status values in migrations and validate allowed values in Laravel form requests or model rules.

## Migration Order

Use this order when creating Laravel migrations:

1. `users`
2. Laravel auth support tables, if selected by the scaffold
3. `staff_profiles`
4. `customer_profiles`
5. `services`
6. `staff_services`
7. `staff_weekly_schedules`
8. `staff_schedule_exceptions`
9. `appointments`
10. `appointment_status_logs`
11. `transactions`
12. `rfm_segments`
13. `promotion_rules`
14. `promotion_suggestions`
15. `feedback`

## Acceptance Scenarios

- A customer account can request an appointment for a service and preferred date/time.
- Staff can confirm a pending request by assigning a staff member and scheduled time.
- The system can detect an overlapping confirmed appointment for the same staff member.
- Staff can mark an appointment completed and record a manual transaction.
- RFM calculations can use completed paid transactions to store promotion suggestions.
- Admin or staff can review, apply, or dismiss promotion suggestions.
- Customer can submit one feedback record for a completed appointment.
- Admin can filter reports by appointment, transaction, promotion, and feedback fields without direct database access.
