# Casa Paraiso Screen Flow

## Purpose

Document the implemented MVP pages, role-based navigation, shared workspace behavior, and main user journeys. Use this flow when extending Laravel routes, controllers, Blade views, or navigation.

The implemented interface uses separate dashboards for admin, receptionist, therapist, and customer. Authenticated roles use a persistent sidebar on desktop. Operational roles use a navigation drawer on smaller screens, while customers use a compact header plus bottom navigation for Appointments, Feedback, and Profile. Customers land on appointment-focused pages after login.

## Route Groups

- Public: unauthenticated pages for landing, service browsing, login, and registration.
- Auth: login, registration, password reset, logout, and authenticated redirects.
- Admin: full management access.
- Receptionist: restricted front-desk appointments, customers, and payments.
- Staff/Therapist: assigned daily operations and personal commissions.
- Customer: appointment booking, status, history, feedback, and profile access.

Route prefixes:

- `/`
- `/login`
- `/register`
- `/admin`
- `/reception`
- `/staff`
- `/customer`

## Shared Layout Rules

- Use Laravel Blade server-rendered pages with Tailwind CSS.
- Use a shared authenticated layout shell with a compact 256px role-specific desktop sidebar and consistent page-heading wrapper.
- Admin and staff collapse the sidebar into a mobile drawer.
- Customer mobile navigation uses a persistent three-item bottom bar for Appointments, Feedback, and Profile.
- Admin and staff pages should use the persistent sidebar with module navigation, page title, search/filter area where needed, and clear primary action buttons.
- Customer pages should stay simpler and appointment-first, with sidebar navigation focused on appointments, feedback, and profile.
- Complex management CRUD uses dedicated create/edit pages. Keep modals for contextual calendar booking, the atomic Admin Finish service flow, short feedback or note entry, and destructive/action confirmation.
- Use compact stat strips for detail and calendar context; reserve larger metric cards for dashboards and analytics-heavy summaries.
- Paginate authenticated record lists at the fixed server-controlled size of 15. Preserve filters and sorting across pages, show the result range on every non-empty page, and do not expose a page-size selector.
- On screens narrower than 1024px, list filters collapse behind a labeled toggle that exposes its expanded state and active-filter count. Show Clear filters only when a filter is active.
- Desktop pagination uses numbered controls; mobile pagination uses Previous, Page X of Y, and Next. Empty result sets show their empty state without pagination.
- Keep operational tables inside labeled, keyboard-focusable horizontal-scroll regions. Calendar week strips and customer month grids may scroll horizontally when seven full-size date targets do not fit.
- Appointment calendars, dashboard previews, service queues, detail-history previews, and form selector collections remain unpaginated.
- All role dashboards should show only actions the current role is allowed to perform.
- Avoid SPA-only navigation patterns; pages should work as standard Laravel routes.

## Receptionist Screens

- Dashboard: today’s bookings, upcoming visits, customer count, and payment activity.
- Appointments: weekly bookings and read-only therapist availability; confirmed create/edit, cancellation, no-show, and completion/payment actions.
- Customers: search, contact details, appointment/payment history, and permitted contact/operational-note updates.
- Payments: create, edit, and review manual transactions.
- Profile: shared account settings. Receptionists cannot access schedules, services, insights, reports, exports, settings, user administration, or commissions.

## Embedded Booking And Commission Screens

- Customer booking opens as a modal from My Appointments and the selected-day panel; `/customer/appointments/create` remains the fallback.
- Admin `/admin/commissions`: filtered pending/paid/adjustment records, totals, source links, and external payout recording.
- Therapist `/staff/commissions`: read-only personal pending, paid, and net totals plus personal history.

## Public Screens

### Landing Page

Access: guest and authenticated users.

Purpose:

Primary actions:

- Guests use the single `Reserve` navigation action to open the login page.
- Authenticated users open their role workspace.

## Auth Screens

### Login

Access: guest users.

Purpose:

- Authenticate with a verified email and password or Google OAuth. Unknown verified Google accounts and public registrations become customers; privileged emails must be pre-authorized.
- Keep the login page focused on password and Google sign-in without promoting account creation; public registration remains available directly at `/register`.
- On desktop, keep the overall login shell fixed to the viewport and allow only the form pane to scroll when short heights, zoom, messages, or expanded guidance require it. Mobile retains normal document scrolling.

Post-login redirect:

- Staff users go to `/staff/dashboard`.
- Customer users go to `/customer/appointments`.

### Register

Admin Availability includes a dated Sunday-to-Saturday team roster. The Admin copies the prior published week into a draft, adjusts therapist shift ranges, then publishes the whole roster.
